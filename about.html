      On July 16, 1945- with 425 people present, the world would witness the
      first detonation of a nuclear weapon. Strapped to the top of a 100-foot
      tower, the bomb- which was informally named the "Gadget", and later become
      the "<a

      into a mushroom-shaped cloud. This atmospheric test- powered by a
      plutonium implosion fission device- would release 25 kilotons of TNT (or
      100 TJ of energy) and be seen up to 160 miles away.

      After the explosion faded away, both shock and euphoria enveloped the
      scientists, as "the atom bomb did not fit into any preconceptions
      possessed by anybody." -<a

      feet over Nagasaki, leading to around 40,000 people died instantly, and by
      January 1946, the death toll was now around 70,000.
